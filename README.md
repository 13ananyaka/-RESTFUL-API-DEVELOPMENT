## Project Overview:
This project involves the design and development of a RESTful API for a Library Management System, aimed at managing core functionalities such as book inventory, user registration, and basic transactions (like issuing or returning books). It follows RESTful design principles and uses structured, standardized endpoints to implement CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete — on all relevant resources.

The objective is to simulate a real-world backend system capable of handling library operations programmatically. This project is particularly focused on building a maintainable, modular backend that can be extended later with a frontend interface or connected to external services such as authentication or cloud hosting.

🔧 Technologies and Tools Used:
Programming Language: Python (with Flask) or JavaScript (with Express.js), depending on the implementation preference.

Database: SQLite or MySQL is used to persistently store library data such as books, users, and records.

API Design: Endpoints are structured around REST principles, using standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to access and manipulate resources.

Testing: API testing was performed using browser tools (fetch() requests in the console) and terminal tools such as curl. No external tools like Postman were used.

Editor: VS Code was used as the primary development environment, offering syntax highlighting, integrated terminal, and debugging support.

JSON Format: All API responses and request payloads follow the JSON format for clarity and consistency.

🔗 API Functionality Summary:
The API provides the following endpoints for core resources:

📚 Books
GET /books – View all books

GET /books/:id – Get a specific book’s details

POST /books – Add a new book

PUT /books/:id – Edit book details

DELETE /books/:id – Delete a book

👤 Users (Borrowers)
GET /users – View all registered users

POST /users – Register a new user

PUT /users/:id – Update user info

DELETE /users/:id – Remove a user

🔁 Optional: Transactions
POST /issue/:book_id – Issue a book to a user

POST /return/:book_id – Return a previously issued book

Each route handles error checking, status codes (200, 201, 404, 500), and basic input validation to ensure data reliability.

🧪 Testing Process:
Rather than using Postman, the API was tested using JavaScript's fetch() API in the browser, or command-line tools like curl. This confirmed the functionality of each endpoint without relying on external testing platforms. Sample payloads were created to test each CRUD action in real time.

💡 Use Cases and Applications:
Academic Submissions: Suitable for software engineering or backend development projects.

Portfolio Building: A good demonstration of real-world backend development for job seekers.

Team Projects: Can serve as the backend for a full-stack system (when connected with a frontend).

Skill Development: Provides hands-on experience with REST principles, HTTP methods, and server-client communication.

🚀 Hosting & Deployment Suggestions:
Although the API was run locally during testing, it can be deployed to services like:
Render or Railway – For fast backend deployment
Heroku (optional) – Free hosting for small backend projects
GitHub – For code versioning and collaboration

🧾 Final Remarks:
This RESTful API project provides a strong foundation for understanding how modern backend systems work. It demonstrates skills in endpoint design, data modeling, and state management. The API is fully functional and ready to be extended with authentication, advanced error handling, pagination, or integration into a full-stack web app.
